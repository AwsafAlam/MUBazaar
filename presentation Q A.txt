Q: There is a primary key email in customer entity . why use another ID ? 
A: The primary key will be used as foreign key to many entities. So, it is an INT data type using 4 byte . email is usually very long
using many bytes. Using email would increase memory usage.

Q: Why product is didvided into many tables ?
A: Query becomes faster and reducing memory usage . Otherwise, product wntity would have many rows named 'electronics', 'appliances' etc

Q: reviewer have FK customer_email instead of customer_id. Why ?
A: review and corresponding email can be sent to manufacturer so that they can know about reviews on their product. ID is redundant here. 

Q: Why there is an ID in customer_ordered_products ?
A: This entity is huge . If there wasn't any ID then same customer, same prod category, same prod id, same quantity would
 create duplicates. This would require again and again query before entering this entity portion . 
So, we defined an ID.


Q: Why there is a password field in credit_card ?
A: That's actually 'transaction_password' which simulated the need of a bank account . Ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3qm2GcJbck


Common Concepts:
If I didn't use review_id to uniqully identify every reviews then there would be no primary key for review entity & If a customer
opens more than one browser gives same review at the same time hits enter to all of them @ the same time then there would be possibility
of same row in the review table.
